  The  Bright  Star  Catalogue  (BSC) is widely used as a source of
  basic astronomical and astrophysical data for stars brighter than
  magnitude 6.5.   The  catalog  contains  the  identifications  of
  included stars in several other widely-used catalogs, double- and
  multiple-star  identifications,  indication  of  variability  and
  variable-star identifiers, equatorial positions for  B1900.0  and
  J2000.0,  galactic  coordinates,  UBVRI photoelectric photometric
  data when they exist, spectral types on  the  Morgan-Keenan  (MK)
  classification   system,   proper  motions  (J2000.0),  parallax,
  radial-   and   rotational-velocity   data,   and   multiple-star
  information  (number  of  components,  separation,  and magnitude
  differences) for known nonsingle stars.  In addition to the  data
  file, there is an extensive remarks file that gives more detailed
  information  on  individual  entries.   This information includes
  star  names,  colors,  spectra,   variability   details,   binary
  characteristics,  radial  and rotational velocities for companion
  stars,  duplicity  information,  dynamical  parallaxes,   stellar
  dimensions (radii and diameters), polarization, and membership in
  stellar groups and clusters.  The existence of remarks is flagged
  in the main data file.

  The  BSC  contains  9110  objects,  of  which  9096 are stars (14
  objects cataloged in the original compilation of 1908  are  novae
  or  extragalactic objects that have been retained to preserve the
  numbering, but most of their data are omitted), while the remarks
  section is slightly larger than the main catalog.    The  present
  edition of the compilation includes many new data and the remarks
  section has been enlarged considerably.

  This  preliminary version of the fifth edition of the Bright Star
  Catalogue supersedes the published and machine-readable  versions
  of  Hoffleit  (1982, Yale University Observatory) and is intended
  for use until the final verison of this edition is completed.  It
  has  been  made  available  only   for   dissemination   on   the
  Astronomical Data Center CD ROM.

  The  brief  format description applies to the preliminary version
  of the catalog only.   The  format  will  change  for  the  final
  edition.
