COMMENT Preliminary Version of the Bright Star Catalogue, 5th Revised Edition   
COMMENT                                                                         
COMMENT The Bright Star Catalogue (BSC) is widely used as a source of basic     
COMMENT astronomical and astrophysical data for stars brighter than magnitude   
COMMENT 6.5.  The catalog contains the identifications of included stars in     
COMMENT several other widely-used catalogs, double- and multiple-star           
COMMENT identifications, indication of variability and variable-star            
COMMENT identifiers, equatorial positions for B1900.0 and J2000.0, galactic     
COMMENT coordinates, UBVRI photoelectric photometric data when they exist,      
COMMENT spectral types on the Morgan-Keenan (MK) classification system, proper  
COMMENT motions (J2000.0), parallax, radial- and rotational-velocity data, and  
COMMENT multiple-star information (number of components, separation, and        
COMMENT magnitude differences) for known nonsingle stars.  In addition to the   
COMMENT data file, there is an extensive remarks file that gives more detailed  
COMMENT information on individual entries.  This information includes star      
COMMENT names, colors, spectra, variability details, binary characteristics,    
COMMENT radial and rotational velocities for companion stars, duplicity         
COMMENT information, dynamical parallaxes, stellar dimensions (radii and        
COMMENT diameters), polarization, and membership in stellar groups and clusters.
COMMENT The existence of remarks is flagged in the main data file.              
COMMENT                                                                         
COMMENT The BSC contains 9110 objects, of which 9096 are stars (14 objects      
COMMENT cataloged in the original compilation of 1908 are novae or extragalactic
COMMENT objects that have been retained to preserve the numbering, but most of  
COMMENT their data are omitted), while the remarks section is slightly larger   
COMMENT than the main catalog.  The present edition of the compilation includes 
COMMENT many new data and the remarks section has been enlarged considerably.   
COMMENT                                                                         
COMMENT This preliminary version of the fifth edition of the Bright Star        
COMMENT Catalogue supersedes the published and machine-readable versions of     
COMMENT Hoffleit (1982, Yale University Observatory) and is intended for use    
COMMENT until the final verison of this edition is completed.  It has been made 
COMMENT available only for dissemination on the Astronomical Data Center CD ROM.
